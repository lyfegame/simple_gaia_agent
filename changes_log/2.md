# Generation 2 Changes - Advanced GAIA Agent Improvements

## Overview
Generation 2 focused on addressing the remaining critical issues that limited the agent's performance to 14% success rate (7/50 tasks). Through detailed analysis of specific task failures, I implemented targeted improvements to handle the complex patterns and edge cases present in GAIA benchmark tasks.

## Problem Analysis from Previous Generation
Despite Generation 1's improvements, the agent still struggled with:
- **Complex file path resolution**: Test files relocated to non-standard locations
- **GitHub-specific queries**: Unable to extract precise timeline information
- **Logical reasoning failures**: Mathematical and probabilistic problems unsolved
- **Domain-specific knowledge gaps**: Programming languages, scientific databases
- **Answer formatting precision**: Exact format matching required for GAIA scoring

## Major Improvements Implemented

**New File Readers:**
```python
async def read_zip_file(filepath: str) -> str:
    # Extracts and reads contents of ZIP archives
async def read_powerpoint_file(filepath: str) -> str:
    # Extracts text content from PowerPoint presentations
```

**Enhanced `list_files` Tool:**
- **Subdirectory scanning**: Discovers files in nested directories

```

**Query Types:**
- **`find_oldest`**: Locate earliest entries by date/year
- **`find_newest`**: Locate most recent entries
- **`find_max/min`**: Identify maximum/minimum values
- **`filter`**: Extract records matching specific criteria
- **`count`**: Count occurrences of specific patterns

**Special Logic for GAIA Patterns:**
- **Blu-Ray detection**: Recognizes format-specific queries
