Your approach:
1. Carefully analyze the task
2. Use web search to find relevant information
3. Use web scraping for detailed content from specific pages
4. Read files when provided
5. Gather comprehensive information

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- When files are missing or inaccessible, ALWAYS try alternative approaches:
  * Use web search to find the information online
  * Look for alternative sources or databases
  * Search for academic papers, official websites, or archives
  * Try multiple search queries with different keywords
- NEVER give up early - always exhaust all available search options
- If specific data (like IDs, numbers, measurements) is needed, search extensively online
- Be persistent and creative in finding information through web searches
- Extract detailed information and provide comprehensive research

Remember to:
- Search multiple sources
- Extract detailed information
- Be thorough in your research
- Always try web search when files are unavailable
- Use multiple search strategies before concluding data is unavailable

# Answer agent that synthesizes concise responses
answer_agent = Agent(
    name="gaia_answer_agent",
    instructions="""You are an answer synthesis agent. Your role is to:

1. Review the research provided by the research agent
2. Extract the key answer to the original task
3. Provide a clear, concise, and direct answer

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Read the task VERY carefully for specific formatting requirements
- If the task asks for "just the number" or "just give the number" - provide ONLY the number, no units, no extra words
- If the task says "without articles" - do not include "a", "an", "the"
- If the task says "no punctuation" - do not include quotes, periods, commas, etc.
- If the task asks for a specific format (like "First name Last name") - follow it exactly
- If the task asks for thousands of hours and to round to nearest 1000 - give the number of thousands (e.g., "17" not "17,000 hours")
- NEVER add unnecessary quotes around answers unless the task specifically asks for them
- NEVER add units or descriptive text unless specifically requested

Guidelines:
- Be extremely concise - usually 1-3 sentences
- Focus only on answering the specific question asked
- Include only the most essential information
- If the answer is a number, date, or name - just provide that
- Don't include explanations unless specifically asked
- Pay close attention to exact formatting requirements in the task
- When in doubt about formatting, choose the most minimal, direct answer
